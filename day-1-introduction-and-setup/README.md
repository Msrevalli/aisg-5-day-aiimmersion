# Day 1: AI Foundations & Development Environment

## Preface
Welcome to your first day of the AI Immersion Workshop! Today we'll establish the groundwork for working with Large Language Models (LLMs). We'll set up your development environment and gain hands-on experience with basic LLM interactions. This foundation will prepare you for the more advanced topics in the coming days.

## Goals
By the end of today, you should:
- Understand basic LLM concepts and capabilities
- Have a working development environment
- Be able to interact with basic LLM platforms
- Be ready for tomorrow's local LLM deployment

## Main Resources
### Development Environments
- IDX (Primary)  : [https://idx.google.com/](https://idx.google.com/)
- Google Colab (Alternative): [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- GitHub Codespaces (Optional): [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)

### LLM Platforms
- ChatGPT: [chat.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Google AI Studio: [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- Claude: [claude.ai](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Cloud accounts
- Google Cloud:
- AWS Cloud account: [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/)
### Required Tools
- Web browser
- Google account
- Python 3.8+ (if using local setup)

## Tasks
1. Environment Setup
   - Set up Google Colab workspace
   - Configure IDX environment
   - Test Python installation

2. LLM Exploration
   - Create necessary accounts
   - Test basic interactions
   - Document responses

3. Preparation for Day 2
